# Music Player Workshop

Minimal music player implemented in various web development frameworks.

### Frameworks

- jekyll
- angular
- react
- svelte
- vue

For each framework, you will find a self-contained npm package under ```packages```.

Each package contains a minified copy of ```lofi-player``` and a copy of the song data files.

### Song Data

Each song has two versions:

(A) Lo-fi js web audio, encoded in my human-readable format [example](https://github.com/tessmero/mp-workshop/blob/main/packages/mp-jekyll/assets/javascript/songs/avalanche.js)

(B) High-quality OGG, standard for music in games.
